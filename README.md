# wsc/dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, with the rake install task adapted from [Ryan Bates](http://github.com/rbates/dotfiles).

## Don't use these

These assume you're me and will also overwrite your existing files without asking.

## Installation

    git clone git://github.com/wsc/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    rake install
