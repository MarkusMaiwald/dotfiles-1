# Will St. Clair dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, with the rake install task adapted from [Ryan Bates](http://github.com/rbates/dotfiles).

## Installation

    git clone git://github.com/wsc/dotfiles ~/code/dotfiles
    cd ~/code/dotfiles
    rake install

## Don't use these

These are designed for my Chef configuration so they will overwrite your existing ones without asking.
